# recipebox

Hello, This was created as my solo project for Coding Dojo's part-time accelerated online program in Python. This app was built using Python, Django, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. It was designed as an application that would allow users to save, edit, store, and share their favorite recipes. Inspired by the idea of recipe boxes which held recipes on hand-written index cards in kitchens of the past, a user sets up boxes for different recipe categories on their profile page. As the user adds recipes, they are added to the box they select, and then can be opened, read, and edited from their profile page. Users also have the option to share recipes, making them public for other users to see. Shared recipes can be added to different users' boxes, though editing priveleges remain with the recipe's original author.
